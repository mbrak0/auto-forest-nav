Average Intensity Region (AIR) algorithm - see "air.py" python script. Development of this algorithm without the weightings applied to the average calculations can be found in "development-no-weights" directory. Development of this algorithm with the weightings applied to the goal correction parameter of completed baseline AIR algorithm (with weights according to a normal distribution scale) can be found in "parameter-tuning" directory.
